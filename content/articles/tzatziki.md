ingredients:
- 1 cup Greek yoghourt 🥣
- 1 cucumber, pelled and grated 🥒
- 2 cloves garlic, minced 🧄
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped (or mint) 🌿
- 1 tablespoon olive oil 🏺
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice 🍋
- Salt and pepper, to taste 🧂🌑

steps:
- After grating the cucumbers 🥒, place them in a fine mesh sieve or a colander and press out as much liquid as possible. For best results, let them sit for a few minutes to drain any extra moisture.
- In a bowl, combine the drained cucumbers 🥒, Greek yogurt 🥣, minced garlic 🧄, olive oil 🏺, lemon juice 🍋, and finely chopped dill or mint 🌿. Mix well until all ingredients are fully incorporated.
- Add salt and pepper 🧂🌑 to taste. Adjust the garlic, herbs, and vinegar according to your preference.
- Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow the flavors to meld. The longer it sits, the better it tastes.
- Give the tzatziki a good stir before serving. It can be served with grilled meats, as a dip for vegetables or pita bread, or as a sauce in gyros.

notes:
- It's crucial to drain the cucumber thoroughly to avoid a watery tzatziki.
- Tzatziki can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days.
