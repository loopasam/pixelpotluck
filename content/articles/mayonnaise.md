ingredients:
- 1 large egg yolk 🥚
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 🟡
- 1 lemon, juice 🍋
- 1 cup vegetable oil 🏺
- Salt, to taste 🧂
- Black pepper, to taste 🌑

steps:
- In the blender or food processor, combine the egg yolk 🥚, Dijon mustard 🟡, and lemon juice 🍋. Blend them together until well mixed.
- With the blender running on low speed, slowly drizzle in the olive oil 🏺. This process should be gradual to ensure the mixture emulsifies properly, do not go to fast.
- As the mixture starts thickening, continue adding oil 🏺 until you've used up the entire cup.
- Once all the oil is incorporated and the mayonnaise has reached a thick consistency, season it with salt 🧂 and pepper 🌑 to taste.
- Transfer the mayonnaise to a container and refrigerate.

notes:
- Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature for best results.
- If the mayonnaise is too thick, you can thin it by whisking in a teaspoon of water.
