ingredients:
  - 2 medium eggplants 🍆
  - 3 tablespoons tahini 🥄
  - 1 lemon, juice 🍋
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced 🧄
  - 1 tablespoon Greek yoghourt 🥣
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt 🧂
  - 1/8 teaspoon pepper 🌑
  - 1 teaspoon sumac 🌿
  - 2 tablespoon olive oil 🏺
  - 1 teaspoon red pepper flake (optional) 🌶️

steps:
  - Preheat your oven or grill to 200°C (400°F). Poke the eggplants 🍆 several times with a fork, then place them on a baking sheet. Roast for 30-40 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin is charred and the insides are soft.
  - Remove the eggplants 🍆 from the oven or grill and let them cool (at least 15 minutes). Once cool enough to handle, peel off and discard the skin.
  - Place the eggplant flesh 🍆 and all the other ingredients in a food processor (🥄, 🍋, 🧄, 🥣, 🧂, 🌑, 🌿, 🌶️). Pulse until smooth.
  - Transfer to a serving dish, drizzle with a bit more olive oil 🏺, and garnish with parsley and pomegranate seeds if desired. Serve with pita bread or fresh vegetables.

notes:
  - Can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
