ingredients:
  - 2 medium eggplants 🍆
  - 3 tablespoons tahini
  - 1 lemon, juice
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 tablespoon Greek yoghourt
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1/8 teaspoon pepper
  - 1 teaspoon sumac
  - 2 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 teaspoon red pepper flake (optional)

steps:
  - Preheat your oven or grill to 200°C (400°F). Poke the eggplants several times with a fork, then place them on a baking sheet. Roast for 30-40 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin is charred and the insides are soft.
  - Remove the eggplants from the oven or grill and let them cool (at least 15 minutes). Once cool enough to handle, peel off and discard the skin.
  - Place the eggplant flesh and all the other ingredients in a food processor. Pulse until smooth.
  - Transfer to a serving dish, drizzle with a bit more olive oil, and garnish with parsley and pomegranate seeds if desired. Serve with pita bread or fresh vegetables.

notes:
  - Can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
